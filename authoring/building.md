### Running the build

#### Windows

Double click the `build.cmd` file in the project directory. It opens a window with the log output from the typesetter. It will stay open after the build finished. You can close it by pressing _any key_.

_NOTE: Windows builds are untested and the build script for Windows needs some love. Feel free to contribute._

#### macOS & Linux

Open a terminal and run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
./build.sh --docker
```

You can watch the source files for changes and automatically rebuild by appending the `--watch` flag. For more details on this and typesetting to different formats (e.g. HTML for publishing online or plaintext for running it through [languagetool.org](https://languagetool.org/)) append the `--help` flag.
