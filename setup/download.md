# Retrieving a copy of the template

Before you dive in to writing a document using the template you need to obtain a copy. There are two methods for doing this.
The first method is useful if you want to get started quickly or have not worked with `git` before and don't intend to learn it<sup>1</sup>,
while the second one offers more flexibility,
keeps a history of all changes to the document,
allows you to contribute changes to the template for others to use them and holds a copy of your work securely on GitHub.

## Downloading the latest version

1. Download the latest template from [here](https://github.com/TexNAK/Science-Paper-Template/archive/master.zip).
1. Extract the Archive with your favourite tool (WinRAR, 7zip, Archive Tool)
1. Rename the `Science-Paper-Template` folder to something descriptive
1. Place it somewhere other than your Download folder ðŸ˜‰

It can safe you a lot of time and hassle and potentially protect you from loosing your work because your laptop died or you can't find that damn USB stick with all the important documents on it.</sub>
